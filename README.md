## **Project Description** ðŸ“‹

The objective of this project is to develop a web application to:

<ul>
<li>Perform text extraction from handwritten text extraction</li>
<li>Save the data/transaction to blockchain</li>
<li>Integrate database connectivity to maintain the integrity of blockchain</li>
</ul>

To achieve this goal, we have 
<ul>
<li>Fine-tuned the existing TrOCR model on a custom dataset containing the medical prescriptions. </li>
<li>Used flask framework to handle the backend operations.</li>
<li>Ensured login,register and logout functionality with the help of mysql connectivity using python.</li>
<li>Created two modules, one for mysql connectivity and one to add blockchain functionality to the APIs.</li>
<li>Lastly, we also got thorough with the interface of Postman which we used for API testing.</li>
</ul>

Overall, our project delivers a strong integrated logic along with a decent frontend interface for a better experience.
